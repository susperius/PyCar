This module should provide you some basic functionality to communicate with your car via an ELM327 Obd2 to USB
Adapter.

Before you'll be able to use the module you need to install PySerial.

I was only able to test the module in my own car (it's a Ford), so don't blame me if something bad will happen or the
module isn't working, in this case please send me your log (e.g. the answer of your car)

Thanks and Have fun!
